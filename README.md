# Haskell Extension Pack

This extension pack packages some of the most popular (and some of my favorite) Haskell extensions.

## Extensions Included

- [Haskell](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haskell.haskell) - Haskell language support powered by the Haskell Language Server and ghcide
- [Haskell Syntax Highlighting](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=justusadam.language-haskell) - Syntax support for the Haskell programming language.
- [haskell-linter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hoovercj.haskell-linter) - An extension to use hlint in vscode

## Dependencies

[haskell-linter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hoovercj.haskell-linter) expects a version of [hlint](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint) >= 1.9.1 to be installed and already added to the path.
